#Intelligent Document Processing Model
Welcome to the repository for the Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) model! This machine learning model is designed to read and extract data from various types of documents, transforming unstructured content into actionable insights with high accuracy.

#Features
Document Reading: Capable of interpreting text from scanned images, PDFs, and other document formats.
Data Extraction: Identifies and extracts relevant data fields such as names, dates, and numerical values.
Customizable: Easily adaptable to different document types and data extraction needs.
High Accuracy: Utilizes advanced machine learning techniques to ensure precise data extraction.
